India is an agrarian country and its economy is largely based on crop productivity. Hence, we
can say that agriculture can be the backbone of all the business in our country. The agriculture
plays a dominant role in the growth of the country’s economy. Climate and other environmental
changes has become a major threat in the agriculture field. Machine learning (ML) is an
essential approach for achieving practical and effective solutions for this problem. Crop Yield
Prediction involves predicting yield of the crop from available historical available data like
weather parameter, soil parameter and historic crop yield. This focus on predicting the yield of
the crop based on the existing data by using Random Forest algorithm. The prediction will help
farmer to predict the yield of the crop before cultivating onto the agriculture field. To predict
the crop yield in future accurately Random Forest, a most powerful and popular supervised
machine learning algorithm is used.

This Project sought to predict crop yield based on certain attributes such as crop, pH, Rainfall,
etc, also suggests some high yield crops for those conditions. The outcome of this project would
be a web application that calculates crop yield and recommends some high yielding crops.
